# GEE-hydroatlas-subbasin-extractor
Extract HydroATLAS Level-12 sub-basins intersecting a buffer around each Ontario gauge and export as zipped shapefiles (one per gauge) with an optional combined ZIP. Supports client-side export (quick, but heavy for large jobs) and Earth Engine â†’ Google Drive export (safer at scale).
